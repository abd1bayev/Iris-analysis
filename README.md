Iris versicolor - Iris setosa - Iris virginica

Where to get started?
Environment. We will use jupyter.

In Data science, the winning combo is pandas (and/or numpy), matplotlib, sklearn (and/or keras).
In this project we will use:

pandas to load the data
matplotlib to do the visualization
sklearn to do the prediction
